# Mono Compatibility Checker for Unity

How can you check if a .NET Framework API (e.g. System.IO.Directory::Exists) is available on Web Player? Using [Mono Compatibility](http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/MonoCompatibility.html) page is one of the options but not very useful for its size.

The *Mono Compatibility Checker* gives you an instant solution for this problem. Input the class name and select a profile, and then you can get the list of the available functions in that class.
